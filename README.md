  * 🔨 **HARDWARE:** *VEX V5* Robotics hardware is a system of motors, sensors, and components for building and competitive settings.
  * 🧑‍💻 **SOFTWARE:** The software engineering is used in **C++** and enables robot control through **VEXcode V5** using graphical or text-based programming.

## 📌 Project 1: Path Movements & Gyro Sensor Installation
### 🔍 Overview:
In [Project 1](Project_1/project_1.md), we focused on programming a **VEX Robotics** robot to execute a series of movements and solve a specific path-following challenge. The following tasks were completed:

✅ **Forward and Reverse Movements:** Programmed the robot to drive forward and backward for precise distances.
✅ **Accuracy in Positioning:** Ensured that the robot remained within a **20 cm tolerance** from its starting point after completing each sequence of movements.
✅ **Gyro Integration:** Added a **gyro sensor** to the robot's hardware configuration, enabling accurate turns and enhanced control.
✅ **Fixed Turning Directions:** Corrected the turning behavior by adjusting motor configurations, ensuring the robot turns as expected.
✅ **Path Following:** Coded the robot to autonomously follow a difficult, predefined path with accuracy using the drivetrain and sensors.

## 🎮 Project 2: Controller Controls & Emergency Stop Button
### 🔍 Overview:
In [Project 2](Project_2/project_2.md), we focused on programming the functionality of the **VEX V5 robot** using a wireless controller. The main objectives were:

🎮 **Wireless Controller:** Implemented functionality for the wireless controller, where each button was assigned a specific action, ensuring smooth connectivity between the controller and the robot.
⛔ **Emergency Stop:** Created an emergency stop mechanism by mapping the bumper on the V5 robot to stop all movements instantly.
🔄 **Gyro Sensor for Circular Movement:** Integrated the **gyro sensor** to detect **360-degree rotations** when the robot drove in a circle.

## 🔍 Project 3: Obstacle Avoidance and Vision Tracking
### 🔍 Overview:
In [Project 3](Project_3/project_3.md), we programmed a **VEX V5 robot** for **autonomous navigation and object tracking**. Using an **ultrasonic sensor**, the robot detected and avoided obstacles. We also connected to the **Vision Sensor** via Wi-Fi, allowing real-time access to the camera feed.

🛑 **Ultrasonic Sensor:** Used for obstacle detection and collision avoidance. The robot stopped or changed direction when an object was detected within a certain range.
📷 **Vision Sensor Connection:** The **VEX V5 Brain** generated a Wi-Fi network, allowing real-time camera feed access through a web browser.
🟩 **Object & Color Tracking:** The **Vision Sensor** recognized and tracked a specific color, enabling the robot to follow a **green cube** in real-time.

## Project 4: Line Tracking Robot  

Project 4 focuses on developing a VEX V5 robot capable of autonomously following a line using three line sensors. The program dynamically adjusts motor speed and direction based on real-time sensor input to ensure precise tracking.  

### 📌 Key Feature  
✔️ **Line Tracking:** Uses three sensors (Left, Center, Right) to follow a line.  

A key component of the project is the integration of a live status display on the VEX Brain screen, providing real-time feedback on the robot’s movements.  

### 📌 Key Feature  
✔️ **Real-Time Status Display:** Shows tracking information on the VEX Brain screen.  

To enhance navigation, the robot includes a memory function that recalls the last detected line position, allowing it to make smarter adjustments.  

### 📌 Key Feature  
✔️ **Memory Function:** Remembers the last detected line position for smoother navigation.  

The program also utilizes multi-threading to handle both tracking logic and screen updates simultaneously, ensuring smooth operation.  

### 📌 Key Feature  
✔️ **Multi-Threading:** Runs tracking logic and screen updates simultaneously.  

By integrating efficient sensor data handling, the robot optimizes its movement, making adjustments based on sensor readings to stay on course.  

### 📌 Key Feature  
✔️ **Adaptive Motor Control:** Adjusts speed dynamically based on sensor readings.  
✔️ **Efficient Sensor Integration:** Optimized data handling for precise movement.  

This project leverages **C++**, **multi-threading**, and **sensor integration** to enhance tracking efficiency and responsiveness.
