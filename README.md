### English:
A class project exploring **STEM** *(Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics)* through robotics design. This repository features innovative ideas, problem-solving, and teamwork in creating functional robots. It combines coding, engineering, and creativity to showcase real-world applications of robotics in STEM fields.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is developed and designed by students in T√¶knisk√≥linn Iceland. I am working with both hardware and software in this project, combining physical components with programming to achieve the desired functionality. This project is for educational purposes only.

## Project 1
### Overview:
In [Project 1](Project_1/project_1.md), we focused on programming a VEX Robotics robot to execute a series of movements and solve a specific path-following challenge. The following tasks were completed:

+ Forward and Reverse Movements: Programmed the robot to drive forward and backward for precise distances.
+ Accuracy in Positioning: Ensured that the robot remained within a 20 cm tolerance from its starting point after completing each sequence of movements.
+ Gyro Integration: Added a gyro sensor to the robot's hardware configuration, enabling accurate turns and enhanced control.
+ Fixed Turning Directions: Corrected the turning behavior by adjusting motor configurations, ensuring the robot turns as expected.
+ Path Following: Coded the robot to autonomously follow a difficult, predefined path with accuracy using the drivetrain and sensors.
  
These improvements were made to enhance the robot's ability to execute precise movements and solve complex tasks autonomously.
